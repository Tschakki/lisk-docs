##Technology Stack

Lisk software has three key components, the JavaScript code, NodeJS as a compute engine and PostgreSQL as a storage and database solution.

###JavaScript

JavaScript is undeniably the language of the internet. Nearly every website on the Internet uses some form of JavaScript to provide rich functionality for end users. Lisk is written in JavaScript for these same reasons, as well as due to the fact that the language is accessible to practically any developer in the world. With nearly any browser a user can write and test JavaScript code, and with Lisk's aim to be the world's foremost blockchain application platform, with an especial focus on accessibility, it makes sense to use a language that runs on every desktop machine.

###NodeJS

Lisk utilizes NodeJS as the backend computing engine for JavaScript code. NodeJS is extremely flexible and can be deployed to all desktop architectures and many IoT ([Internet Of Things](https://lisk.io/academy/blockchain-basics/use-cases/blockchain-and-iot)) devices. This flexibility gives Lisk the ability to run on any device that has the basic hardware required to support the client.

###PostgreSQL

All blockchains preserve data in different ways, some choose to use SQLite while others use LevelDB. However, these solutions do not provide the same robust features of PostgreSQL.

PostgreSQL is one of the oldest open source relational database systems in the world. With PostgreSQL, a user can store any form of information, such as binary files a music file. This makes PostgreSQL a perfect fit for the Lisk system and provides the necessary database engine to support blockchain applications. In addition to these features, the backup functionality and fault tolerance PostgreSQL offers is unmatched in the open source space.
