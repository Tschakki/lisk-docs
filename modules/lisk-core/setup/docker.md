## Pre-install

This document will detail how to prepare a system to run Lisk Core as a Docker-based container. To run Lisk in Docker a user must first install the Docker Engine. Additionally, it is recommended to install Docker Compose for convenience.

Determine if your platform can run Docker.

###### Supported Platforms
Please refer to https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/#desktop

### Mac OS X

Please refer to https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/. 
Please note that Docker for Mac already includes Docker Compose. 
Install `make` using [XCode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/) 

### Windows

Please refer to https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/
Please note that Docker for Windows includes Docker Compose.

### Linux

Please refer to https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/#server

To install Docker Compose, please refer to https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/

**Important**: Configure Docker, so it can be run without `sudo` rights: https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/linux-postinstall/

Install `make` using your package manager. For example, use `apt-get` if running Ubuntu:

```bash
sudo apt-get install make
```

### Open necessary ports

To connect to the desired network with Lisk Core, please ensure that the corresponding ports are open:

| Network | httpPort(HTTP) | wsPort(TCP) |
| --------|----------------|-------------|
| Mainnet | 8000           | 8001        |
| Testnet | 7000           | 7001        |
| Betanet | 5000           | 5001        |
| Devnet  | 4000           | 5000        |

These are the default ports for connecting with the network, these can be altered later in `.env`.

### Create a new user

To run and manage a Lisk Core node in the future, please create a separate 'lisk' user like so:

#### Ubuntu

The `lisk` user itself **does not need** any `sudo` rights to run Lisk Core. It is sufficient to create a group `docker` and add the newly created user to that group, to enable the user to use Docker (see: https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/linux-postinstall/).
    
```bash
sudo adduser lisk              # create a new user
sudo groupadd docker           # create docker group
sudo usermod -aG docker lisk   # add the user to docker group
```

## Installation

### Get configuration and Makefile

Clone the [Lisk Repository](https://github.com/LiskHQ/lisk-core). 

```bash
sudo -u lisk -i                                    # switch to lisk user
git clone https://github.com/LiskHQ/lisk-core.git  # clone the repository
cd lisk-core/docker                                # navigate into docker directory
```

It contains a directory `docker` with the following files:
- `.env.development`
- `.env.mainnet`
- `.env.testnet`
- `docker-compose.make.yml`: used by `make coldstart`.
- `docker-compose.override.yml`: use this file to overwrite `LISK_` variables (empty by default).
- `docker-compose.redis.yml`: enable cache (optional).
- `docker-compose.yml`
- `Makefile`

The `.env`-files are templates with network specific environment variables.

### Set environment variables

To connect to the Lisk network, the environment variables need to be set accordingly.

Before setting the variables, you may want to edit them in the respective `.env.{network}` file.

It is recommended to change the password for the database, which is stored in `ENV_LISK_DB_PASSWORD`.

To install a specific version of Lisk Core, set the `ENV_LISK_VERSION` to the respective version.

After adjusting them, copy the environment variables to a file called `.env`:

```bash
cp .env.{network} .env
```

Where `{network}` stands for the Lisk network you want to connect to.

### Coldstart application

#### Option 1: Makefile

We recommend using the Makefile.
Makefile provides a convenient way to [sync your node from snapshot](../administration/docker.md#sync-from-snapshot):

```bash
make coldstart  # will download and restore from a recent blockchain snapshot for you
```

> **Note:** If you want to synchronize your node starting form the genesis block, it might take a significant amount of time until your local node will be fully syncronized with the blockchain network.
> We recommend to use "make coldstart" in case you want/need your node ready to use quickly.

```bash
make  # will sync from genesis block on first startup
```

#### Option 2: docker-compose

```bash
docker-compose up -d # initialize Lisk Core
docker-compose ps    # see the status of Lisk Core
docker-compose logs  # see logs
```

### Verify

As final step, verify your node is connected and in sync with the network, e.g. by asking about your nodes' status by using the API:

```bash
docker-compose exec lisk curl http://localhost:<PORT>/api/node/status --header "accept: application/json"
```

Where `<PORT>` is the network specific `httpPort` of your node.

The result should look like this:

```json
{
  "meta": {},
  "data": {
    "broadhash": "ca930994bc1a6a92a47afb7310e3d9903f5e98ce56a6c5fdf444ba34f24c1543",
    "consensus": 94,
    "currentTime": 1558358294074,
    "secondsSinceEpoch": 94249094,
    "height": 8306047,
    "loaded": true,
    "networkHeight": 8306047,
    "syncing": false,
    "transactions": {
      "confirmed": 928836,
      "unconfirmed": 0,
      "unprocessed": 0,
      "unsigned": 0,
      "total": 928836
    }
  },
  "links": {}
}
```

When your node is synced, the values of `networkHeight` and `height` should be (nearly) equal.

To fully verify that your node is in sync with the network, go to the [Lisk Explorer(Mainnet)](https://explorer.lisk.io/) or [Lisk Explorer(Testnet)](https://testnet-explorer.lisk.io/) and compare the Network height in the explorer with the height of your node. 
Again, they should be (nearly) equal.

If needed, use the different Explorer tools for further verification, like comparing the last forged blocks on the chain.

From this point, your node should be fully functional.

As next step, check out [Docker Administration](../administration/docker.md) to learn how to manage your Node.
