## Configuration

Show Lisk Commander Config:
```bash
lisk config:show
```

```js
{
	"json": true, // Provide output as json if set to true, otherwise output is table.
	"api": {
		"nodes": [], // Specify nodes to send requests.
		"network": "main"  // Specify a default network. It can be "main", "test", "beta" or a custom nethash.
	},
	"pretty": false // Pretty print JSON output if set to true.
} 
```

### Configure the network

```bash
lisk config:set api.network <NETWORK> 
```
Possible values for `<NETWORK>` are, `test` for Testnet, `main` for Mainnet, `alpha` for Alphanet and `beta` for Betanet.
If you didn't specify specific nodes for Lisk Commander, it will connect to predefined public nodes of Lisk Mainnet or Testnet.

### Configure specific nodes

Specify the node, Lisk Commander shall communicate with.

If you specify more than one node, it will use the first node as default, and the other nodes as a fallback, if the first node does not respond.

```bash
lisk config:set api.nodes https://127.0.0.1:4000,http://mynode.com:7000
```

See more examples with the [`config` command](user-guide/commands.md#config) on the Commands page.

### How to use a custom config file

The configuration file `config.json` is located in `lisk-sdk/commander/src/config.json`.
If you would prefer to store it elsewhere, run Lisk Commander with the environmental variable `LISK_COMMANDER_CONFIG_DIR` set to the path of your choice.

### Override config options 

Some elements of this configuration can be overridden while executing a command, by using the following options:

Setting | Option
--- | ---
Use JSON output | `--json`
Use table output | `--no-json`
Pretty print JSON | `--pretty`
Do not pretty print JSON | `--pretty false`

See concrete examples on the [Commands page](user-guide/commands.md).
